🛠️ **Sick of pip yelling at you on Kali Linux?**  
You’re not alone. Python packaging has become more strict on system-managed environments — which means:

❌ `externally-managed-environment` errors  
⚠️ Annoying “Running pip as root” warnings

So I wrote a simple yet powerful **Bash script** that:

✅ Sets up a virtual environment (the safe way)  
✅ Optionally enables global pip fixes with safety prompts  
✅ Works perfectly on Kali and other Debian-based systems

📸 Check the before vs after results!  
📜 Full code available on GitHub: *[Insert GitHub link]*

🔒 Whether you're a developer or red teamer — this makes pip behave.
